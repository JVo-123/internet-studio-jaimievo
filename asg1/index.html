	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<p>This <em>was</em> my random text</p>

	<h2>Part 2</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>I learned that Google emerged with Web 1.0, which is one of the earliest, if not <em>the</em> earliest, phases of the web. I thought it would be as old as me at the very most, but it makes sense, considering how established it is.</li>
			<li>A decentralized blockchain protocol allows users to own and be compensated for their time and data. I am not sure if I am correctly interpreting the statement from “Evolution of Web” by Pragati Verma, but I think it essentially means the protocol is why platforms like Instagram or Youtube do not own videos or images people post. At least I think that is similar to what the protocol does.</li>
			<li>The web is not stagnant, which is fairly obvious, but it is more apparent hearing it from someone who has almost three decades of experience. As someone who first experienced the web sometime in the 2010s, I forget that it was a lot simpler back then; it had very few fonts and limited colors, versus now where there are hundreds of thousands of fonts and any color available.</li>
		</ol>
	
	<h2>Part 3</h2>
		<h3>Dream Journal</h3>
			<p>My first idea is a dream journal where people can post their recollection of their dreams… but it does not stop there. While people can simply post it for themselves to look back on or among people they give permissions to, they can also post them publicly, which is where people are able to not only read their dreams, but also create works based on them—visual arts, music, video games, stories, even food recipes. It is a fun way for people to see others’ interpretations of whatever wacky journeys their brains took them last night, and also provides inspiration for works as listed earlier and beyond. It may also be a good alternative to AI prompts and art for people who are hesitant to or choose not to use it.</p>
		<h3>Collaborative Time Capsule</h3>
			<p>I also thought of a collaborative time capsule where families, friend groups, and even communities can put together messages, photos, and videos in digital time capsules that can lock until a chosen amount of time. The time capsules can also be unlocked by the owner(s). Owners can also limit the amount of media individuals can put into the capsules to avoid it being overwhelming (and for easier moderation with what is being put into the capsules. The idea of a digital time capsule already kind of exists (like a shared album on iPhones), which is why I am leaning more towards my first idea, but I wanted to write this idea down in case I do not follow through with it.</p>
