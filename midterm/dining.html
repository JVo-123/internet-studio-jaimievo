                <h2>Stardrop Saloon</h2>
                
                <p>This establishment is owned and run by Gus. He serves a variety of foods and alcoholic beverages. What makes his restaurant so special is the fact that he sells his recipes too! While it may not seem like a good business practice, he is a very skilled chef, so it’s very worth having him cook your meal.</p>

                <h2>Movie Theater</h2>
                <p>
                    The movie theater was built in-place of the Joja Mart that’s shut down. And the town loves it! You can invite your friends and/or partner to a nice movie and meal prepared by the movie theater. Who wouldn’t want to watch a good movie with friends and family while chowing down on delicious food?

                <h2>Jodi's Kitchen</h2>
                <p>
                    Now this is an interesting place to dine, owned by Jodi. Here you can get the finest Calamari and Ice Cream, all homemade. Literally, it’s in her house! While it isn’t the most conventional establishment, it truly is a cozy setting to eat some of Pelican Town’s cuisine. Additionally, you might hear Jodi’s son, Sam, practicing with his band.
