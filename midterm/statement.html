            <p>Stardew Valley is a video game with a pixelated style. For the most part, it's a very peaceful and relaxing game, filled with tons of different things to do, like: farming, fishing, decorating, fighting, mining, quests, romance, friendships, and maybe a little bit of trolling. It's a lot more fun than it looks, and time definitely does speed up when playing the game.</p>
            <p>For the most part of my design choices, I wanted to mimic the look of the actual game. While I was hoping to make it look exactly like the game, to be honest, I couldn't figure it out. I used background-colors and borders to emulate the sort of look that the menus in the game had. The navigation buttons are also meant to look like the title screen of the game, especially when you hover over them. As for the images, they were all directly from the game. I chose "ADLaM Display" as the font for headings and navigation buttons mainly because of the diamond-looking parts of the font, such as: the dot on the i, the little points on the t, etc. It kind of felt like a nod to the pixelated style of Stardew Valley. It was also bold by default, so it added emphasis to whatever text had that typeface. The reason why I chose "Abhaya Libre" for the smaller texts was because it was skinny and serif, which made it look somewhat professional. It might seem odd that the sans-serif font is the heading typeface instead of the content, but I thought the switch-up plays well into the craziness of the game. Plus, it's easier to see the little diamond details as headings.</p>
            <p>I don't really mind that I couldn't copy the exact look of the game. This is meant to be a website for the town in the game and not directly connected. There's a lot I wish that I knew how to do, but I either couldn't remember how to do certain properties and syntax, my notes didn't have what I needed, or I just didn't learn some of the things I wanted to do. Some things like the Activities section is a little wonky, and the Dining section's text was increased to compensate for the empty space. Despite a few workarounds I had to do with my limited knowledge, it was fun testing out things that I've learned, even if I didn't remember everything without notes.</p>
