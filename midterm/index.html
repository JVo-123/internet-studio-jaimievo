                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Pelican Town, a nice getaway (and potential home) near the beachside of Stardew Valley, far from the hustle and bustle of the city. There are a ton of local businesses where you can purchase fresh produce, furniture, supplies, and lots more! Here in Pelican Town, there is a large emphasis on community with loads of events that take place each season, from the Egg Hunt to the Feast of the Winter Star. There’s also a forest, mine, quarry, desert, and island if you’re feeling adventurous. We’re looking forward to seeing you!</p>
