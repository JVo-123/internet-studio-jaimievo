  <h1>Assignment 3</h1>
  
  <h2>Part 2 of 3</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Violation of number 6 (clickable elements are not obvious): <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale School of Art</a></li>
  	<p>The website is chaotic, and a little tricky to navigate. Although the website is intentionally chaotic, functionally, it's a little difficult to find links, given that some of them don't have some sort of underline or font style that indicates that the links are clickable.</p>
    <li>Framing my project in a story format will create a memorable, effective, and enjoyable experience for the audience that I'm targeting. This would allow users to have some sort of emotional connection with the website, giving it as much life, value, and meaning as movies and books would. Having a storyline or story format for my project would also be useful to give myself a certain direction of what I want the project to be, rather than aimlessly coding information (which wouldâ€™ve also been helpful if the project was a collaborative effort).</li>
    <li>Order of data, font size, spacing, colors, style, case (all caps adds emphasis), font weight, and typefaces themselves (serif and sans-serif) can all establish hierarchy in typography design. <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> is an example of good typographic hierarchy.</li>
  </ol>
