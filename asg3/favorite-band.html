	<h1>Red Velvet</h1>
	<p>Red Velvet is a K-pop girl group under SM Entertainment. On August 1, 2014, the group debuted with the single "Happiness" with four members: Irene, Joy, 
		Seulgi, and Wendy. Yeri, their fifth member, joined in March 2015, following the release of "Ice Cream Cake." The name "Red Velvet" comes from two
		musical and stylistic concepts; their "Red" side symbolizes their vibrant, bright image and sound, while their "Velvet" side represents their softer side.<a src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Velvet_(group)">Wikipedia Page</a></p>
	<p>I first discovered them through another group's performance cover of "Psycho", Red Velvet's most popular and awarded song. The song starts with the pluck of a string
		instrument, then suddenly, has this pop and electrical sound that completely diverts expectations. Since then, I listened to a lot of their songs. They're my favorite 
		because of their music style. Their upbeat style of music puts me in a good mood, and their songs sound almost dream-like at times. "In & Out is probably my favorite song from them.</p>
