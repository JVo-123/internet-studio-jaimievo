	<p>Red Velvet is a K-pop girl group under SM Entertainment. On August 1, 2014, the group debuted with the single "Happiness" with four members: Irene, Joy, 
		Seulgi, and Wendy. Yeri, their fifth member, joined in March 2015, following the release of "Ice Cream Cake." The name "Red Velvet" comes from two
		musical and stylistic concepts; their "Red" side symbolizes their vibrant, bright image and sound, while their "Velvet" side represents their softer side.</p>
