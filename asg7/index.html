                <p>Magnus Rasmodius is a mysterious wizard that lives in a tower far west of Cindersap Forest, west of Pelican Town in Stardew Valley. He has the ability to transport himself across the town and the ability to speak with magical creatures, such as Junimos. And, of course, he's a master of potion-making.</p>

                <p>Rasmodius would be an excellent president for many reasons. He's full of deep wisdom and patience, proven by decades of studying arcane knowledge and his calm demeanor. He has respect for nature and balance, allowing him to communicate with the Junimos and enforce peace between the Shadow Folk and Dwarves. With his knowledge of the world of magic and unmagic, he's capable of bridging the gap between two vastly different societies. Rasmodius is not one to seek power for his own benefit, but for the sole purpose of protecting the valley and its magical balance.</p>

                    <p>Now you may be wondering: "Why the homeless man?" Well that's because he's homeless by choice. He isn't looking for money from the valley or anyone in the world. He also enjoys the nature in the valley, and will put in the work to protect it.</p>
