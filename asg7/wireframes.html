                    <li>What are the advantages and disadvantages of sketching wireframes over wireframe software?</li>
                        <p class="first_indent">Sketching wireframes has a few advantages. First off, it’s a really quick way to visualize ideas without having to browse through libraries or worrying about technological skills. Next, sketching allows more freedom for ideas, while some wireframe and/or prototype apps are focused on structure, constraining the full ideas that can be made in a sketch. Another advantage of sketching is the focus on structure, content, function, and behavior and is very simple, limiting distractions from the infinite amount of fonts, colors, and styles some wireframe apps have. There are also quite a few disadvantages sketching has. There aren’t master templates in sketches, and there’s a limited amount of customization (including media links for videos, animations, and other interactions). Sketching also has little to no way of knowing who made changes to the wireframe, especially traditionally, and has no standardization because people tend to have drastically different styles. Sketching would be difficult for collaboration in general. Finally, unless someone was in an art class, or is decent at art, sketching would be especially hard to both do and read.</p>
                    <li>Write a paragraph on which type of wireframing style would work best with your project and why.</li>
                        <p class="first_indent">While my website and myself are greatly influenced by art, I may have to use wireframing software. I do have graphic design softwares that are capable of overcoming the disadvantages of sketching, but most of the time I handdraw things, I end up getting caught up in perfectionism, which takes up a lot of time. Or when in doubt, do both. I’ll start off with greyscale, and once I’m happy with the layout, I’ll add color.</p>
