    <p>Evelyn Wang is a character from the film released on April 8, 2022 called "Everything Everywhere 
    All At Once". The movie was written and directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert and produced with 
    Anthony and Joe Russo and Jonathan Wang. It's an action and sci-fi story (with sprinkles of comedy)
    that covers topics such as: nihilism, 
    existentialism, information overload, generational trauma, and many more topics.</p>
    
    <p>The story follows a woman named Evelyn Quan Wang, a Chinese immagrant that runs a laundromat in 
    America with her husband, Waymond Wang. She also lives with her father. As presented in the film, she
    has a lot of struggles in her life: she struggles with the IRS, her father is constantly dissatisfied
    by her, her relationship with her daughter is rocky... it's all overwhelming. When she was being audited
    by the IRS, her husband from another universe introduced her to the ability to tap in to and gain abilities
    from other versions of herself from other universes in order to save everything in existence from Jobu Tupaki,
    a powerful person that can do just that without the technology Evelyn was given.</p>
    
    <p>She figures that in order to defeat Jobu, she has to unlock the same ability; however, it may not be
    possible to reach the same level of power. It was Waymond, her husband from her own universe, who ultimately
    teaches her that power and violence isn't the answer to defeating Jobu. The only way the Jobu can be stopped
    is to just talk to Jobu, and convince Jobu as to why existence is important, even if it all will end eventually.</p>
