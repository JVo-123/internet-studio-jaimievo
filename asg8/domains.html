                <h2>Conversation</h2>
                <p>It was very brief considering we both already had ideas of what our domain names would be. My classmate's website would be for augmented reality incorporated into education. Their domain name was fairly short and straight to the point, and pretty literal. As for my domain, it did sort of take a moment for them to understand the meaning, but that didn't seem like much of an issue considering it was just one person who didn't get it until the explanation. And to be fair, I didn't understand what "AR" meant at first, so it should be okay that a little explanation might be needed.</p>

                <h2>Which Was the Best and Why?</h2>
                <p>While it could be bias, I think my first idea "SlumberSpill" was the best. First of all, "NightNotes" is okay, but it reads more as a private dream journal than something that can be shared with others. "DreamDrop" was a pretty close contender because it's kind of like "Wooaahhh new dream just dropped", but there's kind of already a product for it. SlumberSpill is a combination of "slumber" like a slumber party and "spill", like "spilling" exclusive information. Plus, it's cheaper than the other two choices.</p>
