                    <h3>White Hat</h3>
                    <p>The website is an outlet to record and share users' dreams, focused on creativity and community. Some information that was needed are who the targeted users are, what platforms do the audience already use (and what's missing from those platforms), and what features are needed the most on the site. A couple other details to think about are how users would want to interact with dreams (privately, socially creatively, etc.) and what safeguards are needed for posts and works. The way we get information could be through user surveys and feedback and by collaborating with professionals, like dream researchers, artists, and therapists.</p>

                    <p>They were excited, moved, and interested by the concept. It felt like a sanctuary to be vulnerable, imaginative, and just an overall pleasant place to share dreams. The website has the potential to resonate with people who feel unseen and emotionally isolated, making the site a haven for creative souls and sensitive thinkers. There were hopes that the site would foster healing and connection; however, there was some concern about how to protect users' emotional safety.</p>

                    <h3>Black Hat</h3>
                    <p>The generic social media mechanics (likes, follows) might clash with the introspective tone of the website. Overly clinical dream interpretations could alienate users seeking poetic or personal meaning. Emotional vulnerability could lead to overwhelm and misinterpretations, which could also be caused by symbolism that varies in different cultures. Moderation will be needed to prevent judgment or insensitivity. Some other problems that can occur on the site are users that will experience disappointment if they don't receive any answers or attention for their dreams, and trolls or skeptics could also disrupt the safe space. And a couple more downsides that can occur are the amount of emotional labor for the moderators and the risk of this site being misunderstood as pseudoscientific or straight up nonsense, a waste of time.</p>

                    <h3>Yellow Hat</h3>
                    <p>This idea might work because it's non-performative storytelling. It doesn't need to be perfect and can even be nonsensical, which would release pressure from those who aren't experienced writers or can't remember their dreams. The website acting as a medium allows for reflective thought as well, depending on how deep the dream is (or not). The site allows for emotional validation, creative inspiration, community built on depth, and new understanding of self and others. The website could work if we start simple---start as a dream journal, then expand---build emotional safety into UX ("soft mode", anonymous sharing), and offer multiple interpretation modes: poetic, psychological, basic, etc. Creating an aesthetic theme design and possibly creating an optional AI muse for dream reflection.</p>

                    <h3>Green Hat</h3>
                    <p>The website doesn't stop at just a dream journal. It could be used as collaborative art projects and even for creating entire fictional universes together. Since my concept was more like a twitter-inspired platform, I didn't really consider integrating an audio post feature where people can record their dream retellings instead of typing them out. Dream "constellations" can also be used to find dreams that are similar. Users can also choose reflection styles (poetic, analytical, humorous, etc.). There could also be a themed section that highlights dreams that follow a certain theme each week or so. To fix the Black Hat problems, filters can be customized by users, disclaimers can be set, and a strong moderation team can keep watch for any trouble on the site.</p>

                    <p>The subject is a dream-sharing and recording website that also acts as a creative platform for exploring dreams. We're thinking about how to thoughtfully, safely, and creatively plan and safeguard the site by using the Six Thinking Hats. Our goal is to create a space that honors the emotional depth, creative exploration, or the pure fun of dreams and creations while keeping the platform safe to do so. To keep the discussion and process on track, we have to return to the website's core values: creativity, emotional nuance, and connection. There are few conclusions for each hat. The White Hat calls for the need for more user data and technical clarity. The Red Hat believes that the site's emotional core is strong. Emotional safety and symbolic nuance are key challenges, according to the Black Hat. Some positives from the Yellow Hat are the potential for healing, creativity, and connection that come from the website. The Green Hat solves issues brought up by the Black Hat by suggesting emotional filters, disclaimers, and building a moderation team and also gives additional suggestions to enhance the site.</p>

                    <h2><u>How will this change the project?</u></h2>
                    <p class="first-line-indent">Of course I want to keep the dream journal aspect of the website; posting certain journal logs is just optional. I don’t remember if I wrote this anywhere, but I plan on having different journal entry options. I want to give users the option to submit their entries either privately (the default option), publicly, with followers, or with friends. “Friends” are not the same as mutuals by the way; “friends” are hand-selected by users, which is helpful if users bring up names or places only their friends know. I also want to give users the option to record audio entries of their dream retellings in case they’d want to just talk about it while they’re half awake or simply just don’t want to type it all out. Something that I also didn’t consider are “followers.” While I did describe the site as “a dream journal but it’s a social media platform”, it didn’t occur to me that my website could become some numbers game like any other platform, which would take the fun out of everything. People would start lying about the dreams that they’ve had to get attention from people, which completely deviates from the site’s purpose. To combat this, I’ve decided to make the amount of followers people have meaningless to the algorithm; a user with 10 followers and a user with 10,000 will have an equal chance of having their posts show up in the feeds. The amount of followers someone has only really determines how many people will see “followers only” posts and attention if the user leads their followers to their accounts on other platforms. I’ll also include disclaimers that clarify this and a guide that explains what feature does.</p>
