			<h2>Everything Everywhere All At Once</h2>

		<p>The movie is pretty insane, and its humor is pretty good; I think the most laughs this movie got out of me is how bizzare some of the scenes are. At the same time, the movie is really emotional as well. It tackles topics like nihilism and generational trauma and includes a lot of great themes and messages. EEAAO really hit close to home because I relate to the antagonist and their pain. It's a real shame that most of my family didn't understand a lot of what's going on (especially since the characters literally explain the system completely). While the movie can have some crude humor that I'm not a fan of, it's so beautifully written and made.</p>

			<h2>Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse</h2>

		<p>Either it's just been a while, or it's true, but I don't think there was as much love for the first Spiderverse movie as the second movie. I absolutely loved watching it when it came out in theaters! It even got me interested in 3D animation. It was so unique and stylized; I'm also a pretty big fan of animated fight scenes. Now don't get me wrong--the second movie was great. But the thing that puts the first movie over the second is probably because the first movie was incredible as a stand-alone movie. I'm not a big fan of two-part movies, but it's understandable why the movies after had to be broken apart.</p>

			<h2>Prince of Egypt</h2>

		<p>I grew up watching this, and I'm glad that I got to grow up with this movie. It's so beautiful, and the music is amazing. I don't even think you need to be religious (or be of the religion) to enjoy this movie. The movie's story is wonderful, even without knowing about the Bible or religion. There's this one sequence where a vision is told through Eqyptian wall art, which is so creative and phenomenal for its time. The style choice in that scene, although simplified, didn't shy away from the cruelty and terror of what happened. I wish more movies had this much effort put into it both visually and story-wise.</p>

			<h2>Ne Zha 1 & 2</h2>

		<p>I'm lumping in these movies together because I adore both. The visuals and stories are incredible! I love the character designs. And I really cried from these movies because of the sacrifices the characters were making. Maybe I'm just more emotional as an adult because I've been saying I cried to these movies (I'm writing this a little later than the others). It's very interesting to me, seeing an "evil" protagonist--not in a way like Gru from Despicable Me, but more evil for the sole purpose of chaos. It's the first chinese animated film I've seen, and it was a good experience. I do have to add a warning, there are some scenes that are disgusting, but other than that, I give these movies solid 10/10.</p>

			<h2>Lilo & Stitch</h2>

		<p>It's basically the same as other movies I've mentioned. It's beautifully animated and written. I love the watercolor style of the backgrounds, the humor, and the characters. I don't think any other movie where the protagonist adopts an other-worldly creature holds a candle to this movie. I mean, it's okay to be freaked out some being that you've never seen before, but I like how Lilo just accepts Stitch into her life. I also really like Lilo and her sister's relationship/dynamic because it feels really real. They fight and get on each other's nerves, but they still care about each other. At least from personal experience, siblings mostly pass the fighting stage when they're older.</p>

			<h2>Thunderbolts*</h2>

			<img src="images/thunderbolts.jpg">

		<p>Marvel has been at a low for a while, but this movie was actually pretty good. The humor pretty on point, and also tackled a similar theme as Everything Everywhere All At Once. I won't spoil anything, but I am a fan of the main character and an antagonist in the movie. I'm glad that there wasn't any romance. I feel like very often, when a girl and a guy become friends in a movie, they always end up together, and it's just so annoying. Like a guy and a girl can't be friends without ending up in a romantic relationship together, I guess. And maybe I'm just more into slowburn; I like seeing feelings develop over time and not within a single movie.</p>

			<h2>Ultraman: Rising</h2>
		</header>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/ultraman.jpg">

		<p>I can't believe I almost forgot about this movie! It has a cool animation style that vaguely resembles the Laika Studios style (emphasis on "vaguely"). It has a cute (adopted) father-daughter dynamic, which I'm an aboslute sucker for. It was my first and only impression of Ultraman, so I can't really compare it to other Ultraman media, but you don't need to know anything about Ultraman to understand what's going on. The movie is a great stand-alone movie.</p>

			<h2>K-Pop Demon Hunters</h2>
		</header>

			<img src="images/kdh.jpeg">

		<p>I can't believe I almost forgot about this movie too! This movie is fantastic! The animation and characters are absolutely gorgeous. And the songs are also great; I love how the songs are good on their own, but they're so cleverly woven into the movie's plot. I was immediately interested when the trailer came out because I'm a fan of K-pop and animation combat. At the same time, I was expecting the K-pop aspect to be some cheap gimmick to grab the attention of other K-pop fans, but I was pleasantly surprised to see a lot of things that were very specific to K-pop and K-dramas. And not only that, but Korean culture in general. Even people who aren't fans of the music genre liked the movie. I would highly recommend giving the movie a try.</p>

			<h2>Up</h2>

		</figure>
		<p>I watched it again a few months ago, and it was even better than I remember. I first watched it when I was younger, so some of the moments didn't quite land with me as much as they did now. Well, yes, child me did understand that the exposition was sad, but with my knowledge now, understanding death, it really hit me. And the one scene around the end, looking at the scrapbook, I finally understood the protagonist's new motivations. Firstly, I love how this movie is great as a stand-alone. And secondly, I love how it depicts more mature moments that only adults would really understand because despite that, children at least understand the surface-level aspects. The movie just flat out shows that a woman wasn't able to have children, and an old man going to court, these are things that children will obviously not understand much of, but they will still understand that the situation isn't good. The movie doesn't treat children like they're stupid, making the movie also enjoyable to an older audience.</p>

			<h2>Nimona</h2>
		</header>

			<img src="images/nimona.png">
		</figure>
		<p>This movie's great! I like the big eyes of all the characters. It's cute. I like the mix of medieval and futuristic aesthetics because it's fitting for the theme. The main character is surprisingly not Nimona; the protagonist is a gay man. And I'm not just saying that because that's his whole deal, it's just a part of him. I pointed that out because rarely see any gay characters in media unless they're the gay best friend, a background character, or the punchline to a joke. It's refreshing to see a gay character exist as a person, the main character even, and not as the token queer character. It's honestly a real shame that some people would pass on the movie because it has queer characters. The romantic orientation of the characters mean absolutley nothing in this movie; if the protagonist was straight, the plot wouldn't change. If anything, the characters that are queer adds a layer to the themes of the movie. The movie for sure deserves a watch because the theme and conflict definitely parallels to the people who refuse to watch this movie without them even knowing it. They won't know how unless they watch it.</p>

			<h2>Spirited Away</h2>
		</header>

			<img src="images/spiritedaway.jpg">

		<p>Spirited Away is my favorite movie from Studio Ghibli because it's so unique and beautifully animated. I liked how the protagonists turns into a scared child that's confused and overwhelmed by a strange new world, to a part of the society, more independent, and... employed. She cleverly and physically avoids trouble, while also being very kind to others, despite the situation she's in. I probably won't immerse myself in the life she adopts as quickly as she did. And I'll be honest, it's the only Ghibli film I've watched so far that I could both actually understand and remember. This movie played in the hospital when I was born, so maybe it was meant to be. Also I was among all the kids that were traumatized by the parents turned into pigs.</p>

			<h2>A Silent Voice / Shape of Voice</h2>
		</header>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/silentvoice.jpg">
		</figure>
		<p>Honestly, this movie is great. I know I keep saying this, but the movie is so emotional. I really did cry at a couple parts of the movie. I think I just like a lot of emotion in stories. What I loved about this movie is that they used JSL (which I suppose is the bare minimum for a Japanese film about a guy and a deaf girl, but it was cool to see). But the movie mostly follows a guy that actually bullied the deaf girl when they were both kids, and the movie is pretty much about him learning to forgive himself and realizing that he's grown as a person. I've heard some people say that the movie was a love story, a love story between a man and himself, and that's beautiful.</p>
