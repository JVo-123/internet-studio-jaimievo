        <li>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</li>
          <p></p><strong>Structured content defines/labels the elements that are being displayed, 
          while semantic HTML is what gives the content meaning to the webpage. The structured content is kind of like the exposition, rising action, climax, and conclusion of a plot; it is the label to each section. The semantic HTML, on the other hand, are instructions that are legible to the webpage the content is on.</strong></p>
        <li>How do they work together?</li>
          <p><strong>The semantic HTML translates the structured content into markup that the webpage will understand. Structured content is kind of like a cooking recipe, and semantic HTML is like the ingredients that are needed to make the food.</strong></p>
        <li>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</li>
          <p><strong>Structured content is needed for organization purposes; otherwise, the semantic HTML would be difficult for people to follow, even while completed. Semantic HTML is important because it’s what webpages use in order to present the content properly. Without one or the other, it could be confusing for humans and algorithms to understand.</strong></p>

        <li><a href="https://thedreamdrop.com/">The Dream Drop</a></li>
          <p>"A minimalist, anonymous dream logging site that contributes to academic research. It allows users to see dream trends and connect with others nearby, but it doesn’t support multimedia responses or comments."</p>
        <li><a href="https://www.aetherialdream.com/">Aetherial</a></li>
          <p>"Offers a gamified dream journaling experience with 3D visualizations and progression levels. It’s more introspective and symbolic, but lacks collaborative features."</p>
        <li><a href="https://www.dreamboard.com/">Dreamboard</a></li>
          <p>"Focuses on tracking dream patterns and psychological insights. It’s private and analytical, not community-driven."</p>

        <li>Denise Jacobs argues that we all have a troll-like inner critic. Of the methods she identifies to banish this troll, which would be most successful for you? Why?</li>
          <p><strong>I think “Go for ‘Good’ Instead of Superlative” would be the best for me. I have a few ambitious ideas and tend to feel the need to overachieve, but of course, I won’t be able to accomplish everything I want to incorporate in my work. I end up disappointing myself for not reaching standards that I made for myself when I should be happy 
          for at least achieving the minimum of what I’m supposed to do.</strong></p>
        <li>In David McRaney's article, what is "hyperbolic discounting"? List one method McRaney identifies to counteract hyperbolic discounting. Which would work best for you?</li>
          <p><strong>Hyperbolic discounting is “the tendency to get more rational when you are forced to wait”, or in other words: focus on the more present or in-reach rewards instead of the rewards in the future. A method that McRaney identifies is accepting that the me right now is more trustworthy than the future me because I know my own state of mind 
          now, but I’m not so sure about the future me. If I wait for future me to arrive, future me could very well be like now me, and end up pushing back tasks further into the future.</strong></p>
        <li>Critical Web Design addresses four types of power in networks. As you learn web publishing fundamentals, what network-making power do you (or don't you) have as the creator and publisher of your work?</li>
          <p><strong>A network-making power that I don’t have as the creator and publisher of my work is choosing who is and isn’t allowed on the site. For now, I’m okay with anyone on it since the only people who would really know about it are my professor and classmates. But If I were to really have this site open for everyone, there would be a few bad 
          apples that I might need to ban from posting. Another power that I don’t have is even allowing people to post anything yet; I know how to structure basic texts and add images and links, but I haven’t learned how to allow others to post anything yet.</strong></p>
